# Grapher Roadmap

## Ship to App Store (blocked 2026-07-29 — three items left, all dashboard/manual)
Build 202607290328 (v1.1.0) uploaded and VALID on App Store Connect. Metadata complete: all ratings/content rights/categories/copyright/review contact set via asc CLI. Encryption exemption applied. Screenshot done 2026-07-29 (iPhone 6.5", `ios/.asc/screenshots.json`, launch-only capture — app seeds `x^2`/`sin(x)` by default). Availability + free pricing set via ASC dashboard (claude-in-chrome) 2026-07-29, 175 countries. `asc review submit` was attempted and rejected with THREE remaining blockers not caught by `asc validate` until submit-time:
1. **Privacy policy URL missing** — no privacy policy page exists for grapher.heyitsmejosh.com yet. Need to create one (client-side app, no data collection, should be a quick static page) and set via `asc apps info edit --support-url`-equivalent for privacy (check `asc app-setup info set --privacy-policy-url`).
2. **App Privacy declarations unpublished** — not available via public API, needs `asc web privacy pull/plan/apply/publish` (web-session flow) or manual dashboard completion at appStoreConnect.apple.com/apps/6794988370/appPrivacy.
3. **iPad screenshot required** (`ipadPro129`) — app apparently supports iPad (TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY in project.yml probably includes iPad by default from xcodegen), needs a second screenshot capture pass on an iPad Pro 12.9" simulator, same `asc-shots-pipeline` approach as iPhone.

Once all three are done, re-run: `asc review submit --app 6794988370 --version-id 16c69982-180c-4bbc-81d0-de81632d7b97 --build 0103486e-91de-4ac5-8d09-da7b8d07f6b5 --confirm`

## WKWebView shell (reviewed 2026-07-22)
Not a gap — `CLAUDE.md` documents this as intentional ("app has no native API needs"). Unlike Books, this was a deliberate choice, not an oversight. Revisit only if grapher ever needs a real native API (e.g. share sheet, widgets) that the web shell can't provide. If it's ever ported anyway, the blocker is replacing `mathjs` expression parsing/eval with a Swift equivalent — everything else (canvas plotting, equation list UI) maps cleanly to SwiftUI `Canvas`.
